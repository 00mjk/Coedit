## Shared coedit icons
======================

### Description
---------------

The sub folders standing in this directory contains the shared ***Coedit*** icons.
They are currently used by the widgets.

The resource script can be generated by running ***generate_res.d*** as a runnable
module in Coedit itself (this is rather a script than a program).
The program ***LazRes*** must be known by the operating system.

Editors: note that the icons shouldn't be renamed because they are also used by the wiki.

### Licenses

Original license files, when available are located in the _licenses_ folder.
