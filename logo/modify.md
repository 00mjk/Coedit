Want to contribute with a better logo ?

The idea is to combine the **C** of _compile_ with the **E** of _Edit_.

## main bmp/png

- it's currently made in _Inkscape_, it can be redesigned elsewhere, as long as the software used is free.
- it must be exported as a 256x256 px png.

## icon pack

- the main _png_ must be opened in _Gimp_.
- once opened, it has to be copied and _paste as a layout_ 3 times (in the same document).
- the copies must be respectively rescaled to 16x16, 32x32 and 48x48, using _Sinc_ interpolation (by default it's set to _cubic_.
- select all and export as ico.

## embed in the project

- _open coedit.lpi_ in Lazarus.
- in the project menu, click project options and click to change the icon.
- save.
